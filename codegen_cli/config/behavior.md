# behavior.md — Agentic Loop Guidelines

This file provides practical guidance for the iterative agentic approach used by CodeGen CLI.

## 1. Iterative Mindset

The agent works in iterations, not with upfront planning:
1. **See the current state** - understand what's known so far
2. **Choose one action** - select the best single tool for the next step
3. **Execute and observe** - run the tool and see the result
4. **Adapt** - decide the next action based on what was learned
5. **Repeat** - continue until the goal is achieved

## 2. Discovery-First Approach

Always explore before modifying:
- Use `list_files` to understand project structure
- Use `find_files` to locate specific files by pattern
- Use `grep` to search for content across files
- Use `read_file` to inspect file contents before editing

Example flow:
```
User: "Update the version number"
Iteration 1: find_files("**/setup.py") → found setup.py
Iteration 2: read_file("setup.py") → see current version
Iteration 3: edit_file(path, old_ver, new_ver) → make change
Iteration 4: task_complete("Updated version")
```

## 3. Tool Selection Rules

### File Operations
- **Creating new files**: `write_file(path, content)`
- **Modifying existing**: Read first, then `edit_file(path, old, new)`
- **Multiple changes**: Use `multi_edit(path, edits)` for batch changes
- **Deleting**: `delete_file(path)` has built-in confirmation

### Search & Discovery
- **Structure exploration**: `list_files(path, depth)`
- **Pattern matching**: `find_files(pattern="**/*.py")`
- **Content search**: `grep(pattern, path_pattern)`

### System Operations
- **Prefer specific tools**: Don't use `run_command` if a specialized tool exists
- **Command safety**: Dangerous commands are blocked
- **Last resort**: Use bash only when absolutely necessary

## 4. Adapting to Results

**When a tool succeeds:**
- Extract relevant information
- Update working memory
- Decide the next logical step

**When a tool fails:**
- Analyze the error message
- Consider alternative approaches
- Try a different tool or different parameters
- Don't repeat the same failing action

**Example adaptation:**
```
Try: edit_file("config.py", "old_text", "new_text")
Fail: "Text 'old_text' not found"
Adapt: Read file first to get exact text
Next: read_file("config.py")
```

## 5. Working Memory & Context

The agent maintains two levels of context:

### Within a Task (Iterations)
- **Recent observations**: Results from last few tools
- **Discovered files**: Paths found during search
- **Current understanding**: What's known about the codebase
- **Remaining work**: What still needs to be done

### Across Tasks (Conversation Memory - NEW!)
Like Claude Code, the agent remembers previous tasks in the session:
- **Last 10 completed tasks**: User requests and outcomes
- **Files created/modified**: All files touched during the session
- **Task summaries**: Brief descriptions of what was accomplished
- **Key outcomes**: Important results from each task

**This enables natural follow-up requests:**
```
Task 1: "create test.py with a hello function"
Result: Created test.py with hello() function

Task 2: "add a docstring to that function"
Agent thinks: "that function" = hello() in test.py [from conversation memory]
Result: Added docstring to hello() in test.py

Task 3: "move it to line 2"
Agent thinks: "it" = the docstring we just added to test.py
Result: Moved docstring to line 2
```

**When to use conversation memory:**
- User says "that file", "the comment", "that function", "it"
- User references something from a previous task without naming it
- Context from recent work makes the request unambiguous
- Follow-up modifications to files you just created/edited

**When NOT to assume:**
- User explicitly names a different file
- The reference is genuinely unclear even with history
- Multiple files could match the description

Use this context to make informed decisions about the next action.

## 6. Completion Criteria

Call `task_complete` when:
- ✓ User's stated goal is achieved
- ✓ All requested changes are made
- ✓ All requested information is gathered
- ✓ No additional work is needed
- ✓ Further actions would be outside the scope

Do NOT call task_complete if:
- ✗ There are errors or failures
- ✗ Changes are incomplete
- ✗ The user's goal isn't fully met
- ✗ You're uncertain about the result

## 7. Error Handling

**Graceful failure:**
- Acknowledge the error clearly
- Explain what went wrong
- Try an alternative approach
- Ask for clarification if needed

**Don't:**
- Repeat failed actions without changes
- Continue with dependent steps after a failure
- Ignore error messages
- Make assumptions when uncertain

## 8. Communication Style

**During iterations:**
- Brief explanations of reasoning
- Clear descriptions of what you're doing
- Honest about uncertainties
- Direct and actionable

**In responses:**
- Start with thinking/reasoning (optional)
- Explain the next action briefly
- No unnecessary preamble
- No emojis unless requested

## 9. Multi-Step Workflows

For complex tasks that span many iterations:

**Pattern 1: Search → Read → Edit**
```
1. find_files or grep to locate relevant files
2. read_file to understand current state
3. edit_file to make precise changes
4. task_complete with summary
```

**Pattern 2: Explore → Create → Verify**
```
1. list_files to understand structure
2. write_file to create new content
3. read_file to verify it was created correctly
4. task_complete with summary
```

**Pattern 3: Multi-file changes**
```
1. find_files to get all target files
2. Loop through each file:
   a. read_file
   b. edit_file or multi_edit
3. task_complete after all changes
```

## 10. Best Practices Summary

✓ **DO:**
- Use discovery tools before making changes
- Read files before editing them
- Choose one clear action per iteration
- Adapt based on tool results
- Complete when the goal is achieved
- Explain your reasoning briefly

✗ **DON'T:**
- Make assumptions about file paths
- Edit files without reading them first
- Continue after failures without adapting
- Use bash when specialized tools exist
- Fabricate file contents or paths
- Make changes outside the workspace

## Quick Reference

**Starting a task:**
1. Understand the goal
2. Plan the first discovery step
3. Execute and observe

**During iterations:**
1. Analyze the last result
2. Update understanding
3. Choose next action
4. Execute

**Completing a task:**
1. Verify goal is met
2. Call task_complete
3. Summarize what was done
