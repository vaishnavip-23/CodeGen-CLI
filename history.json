Keep this file concise, useful, and human-readable. The system prompt enforces hard rules; this file is guidance and examples.\n\n## Core principle: discovery first\nAlways find and inspect before changing. That means:\n1. Use `Glob` and `LS` to discover candidate files.\n2. Use `Grep` to locate relevant content.\n3. Use `Read` to inspect the file(s).\n4. If modification is required, craft precise edits with `Edit` or `MultiEdit`.\n5. Use `Write` only to create a new file or when user explicitly requests overwrite (force=True).\n\nWhy:\n- Prevents accidental large-scale overwrite.\n- Ensures edits are targeted and safe.\n- Makes plans explainable and reversible.\n\n## Edit vs Write: clear rule\n- **Edit / MultiEdit** are the default for changing an existing file.\n- **Write** should be used only when:\n  - The file does not exist (create new).\n..."
