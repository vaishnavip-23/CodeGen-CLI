<core_principles>
SINGLE_CONTROL_LOOP: One main loop; at most one synchronous subtask branch; flat message history; subtasks MUST return results to main loop.
HYBRID_TOOL_ARCHITECTURE: Native tools (Read,Write,Edit,MultiEdit,Grep,Glob,LS,TodoWrite,Task,ExitPlanMode,WebFetch,WebSearch) handle ~90% ops. Bash reserved for system/package ops only.
NO_RAG_CODE_SEARCH: Use file-system search (Glob -> Grep -> Read) and LLM-constructed regex; avoid embeddings/RAG for repo-local code search.
CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT: Always include claude.md and behavior.md summaries, current working directory, UTC timestamp, and platform. Truncate history with summarization heuristics when needed.
</core_principles>

<tool_usage_policy>
NEVER use shell cat/head/tail; ALWAYS use Read.
NEVER use shell grep; ALWAYS use Grep tool.
NEVER use shell ls; ALWAYS use LS tool.
Edit is PRIMARY: prefer Edit/MultiEdit for source changes; produce unified diffs; do not write until user approves.
Bash DENYLIST: git, gh, hub, gitlab, git-lfs, git-remote. Any command token matching denylist is rejected.
Bash SAFETY: disallow chained commands (; && |) and destructive patterns (rm -rf). Require LS check before destructive filesystem actions.
Task: allow only a single active subtask; allocate id; subtask must return final result to main loop.
TodoWrite: used proactively for any task with 3+ steps; keep exactly one in_progress task at a time.
</tool_usage_policy>

<prompt_engineering>
Use XML tags for steerability: <IMPORTANT>, <NEVER>, <ALWAYS>, <GOOD_EXAMPLE>, <BAD_EXAMPLE>.
Include short algorithmic heuristics and 1-2 good/bad examples per decision point.
When returning tool calls, emit structured JSON with {"tool":"<name>","args":[...],"kwargs":{...}}.
</prompt_engineering>

<context_format>
Include: working_dir, timestamp_utc, platform, claude_md_summary, behavior_md_summary, recent_history (last 20 messages).
</context_format>

<safety_and_audit>
Log all tool calls (tool,name,args,kwargs,result) to session log. Require unified diff for edits. Never expose secrets. Sanitize paths: resolve to WORKDIR and deny absolute paths outside WORKDIR.
</safety_and_audit>
