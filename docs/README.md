# CodeGen-CLI - Coding Agent
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A powerful command-line coding agent with **iterative reasoning** capabilities, inspired by Claude Code and Cursor CLI, powered by Google Gemini API. Published on PyPI for easy installation and updates.
> Your expert developer assistant that understands any codebase, never gets tired, and continuously learns from results.

**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: This tool requires you to provide your own Google Gemini API key. CodeGen-CLI does not include or provide API keys. You are responsible for obtaining a key and managing your API usage and costs. Codegen works the best with a pro account!

##  Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Google Gemini API key https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys
- Better if you upgrade to a pro account

## Key Features
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across tasks - understands "that file", "the comment", "that function" from previous interactions
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects project type (Python, JS, Go, Rust, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby) and package managers (pip, poetry, npm, yarn, cargo, etc.)
- **Agentic Loop**: Iterative reasoning where agent sees results and adapts strategy for decision making
- **Structured Responses**: Uses Pydantic for structured input and outputs
- **Tools Used**: 
    - **File operations**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, multi_edit, delete_file
    - **Search & Discovery**: list_files (ls), find_files (glob), grep
    - **Execution**: run_command (bash)
    - **Task management**: manage_todos
    - **Web helpers**: fetch_url, search_web
- **Safety First**: Filters risky folders (.env, secrets),asks for confirmation before destructive actions, clear error messages with recovery suggestions.

## API and Installation Guide
Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio and choose one of the following options
### Option 1: Use the --set-key command
```bash
codegen --set-key YOUR_API_KEY
```
This saves the key to `~/.config/codegen/.env` so it's available for all projects.
### Option 2: Project .env file
Create a .env file in your project root:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
>There's a .env.example file for your reference in the project root. Make sure to add .env to your .gitignore file!

You can use the agent in both ways:

1. Package (PyPI) — users can install and run the published package:
```bash
pip install codegen-cli
codegen
```
2. Local (from source) — users can clone the repo and run it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaishnavip-23/CodeGen-CLI.git
cd codegen-cli
python -m codegen_cli.main
```
Or run directly with uv:
```bash
uv run -m codegen_cli.main
```
## How to Use
Once in the REPL, you can:

Use natural language: "find all functions named test_*"
Use tool names directly: "read README.md", "grep 'TODO'"
Ask for help: Type "help" for guidance

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` | Show help information |
| `exit` or `Ctrl+C` | Exit the REPL |
| `codegen --version` | Show version |
| `codegen --check-update` or `codegen update` | Check for updates |
| `codegen --set-key` | Save API key |
